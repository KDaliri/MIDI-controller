Can each team member add to as to what they perceive their contribution to the project will have ultimately be?

Renbert Jabez Jose's potential contribution:
What I feel Iâ€™ll be able to contribute to the project is to oversee if certain circumstances will work given our ability to be able to complete certain milestones in the project; things like, 
assembly management and ensuring every little thing is working and inquiring if we need to go back and review it. I find myself more effective when it comes to performing hands-on work like putting the physical components together and overseeing the final product.
