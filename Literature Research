Literature Research
1. Formulate the research and development question(s)

What will the technical specs be?
How will we control midi-software?
How to build a midi-controller?

2. Establish context for your work by showing what has been done within the market 
can you modify your project so as to reach a "niche" market?

The MIDI-controller is catered to guitar players that want to use AMP sims live.

is there a limitation or constraint that you can address to increase the attractiveness of your product?
We are trying to address the limitation of being tied down to a certain manufacturer. We are making this controller an open source, making this product cheaper.

3. Expose the gap within current products in meeting the "need" or solving the "problem"

Current products leave you tied into the hardware’s ecosystem which was created by the manufacturer. With our MIDI-controller, we’re making it an open-source product meaning you can have other products from different manufacturers and being able to switch between them “on the fly”

- how does your proposed product solve the issue that much better (is it cheaper? faster? more accurate?)

You’re not tied to the environments sold to the product you’re buying. 
Not going to be as expensive as others in the market. Since software is already on computer.

4. Refine your "answer" to the "problem"

To be able to seamlessly switch & control different AMPs from different manufacturers
