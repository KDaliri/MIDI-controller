Literature Research

1. Formulate the research and development question(s)

  What will the technical specs be?
  How will we control midi-software?
  How to build a midi-controller?

2. Establish context for your work by showing what has been done within the market

  The MIDI-controller is catered to guitar players that want to use AMP sims live.

can you modify your project so as to reach a "niche" market?

  The product is already targeted towards what could be considered a "niche" market

is there a limitation or constraint that you can address to increase the attractiveness of your product?

Allowing the MIDI controller to seamless switch between multiple applications on the host PC would be the biggest leap forward in terms of the product's limitations or constraints.

3. Expose the gap within current products in meeting the "need" or solving the "problem"

The problem with the current virtual guitar rig market is that there is an ecosystem gap between amp sims used in the studio vs amp sims used in a live setting. Guitarists wanted the convnience of having access to all their tones in a live setting without having to fiddle around with a computer, and so amp modelers were introduced to the market. These are devices that act as a MIDI controller with preloaded software like amp sims and fx. However, the software on these devices are generally considered inferior - or on par at best - to the software exclusive to a computer. As a result, the live rig and the studio rig are typically part of two seperate ecosystems. This is problem #1: The current amp modelers leave the consumer tied to that manufacturers ecosystem. You buy their hardware, you use their software. Some software developers took note of the success of amp modelers and begun releasing their own proprietary hardware units. Once again, this leaves the consumer tied to the manufactureres ecosystem. This sets a dangours precedent for anti-consumer practices, which will become problem #2: Companies will make their MIDI controllers proprietary, further enforcing problem #1.
  
- how does your proposed product solve the issue that much better (is it cheaper? faster? more accurate?)

our product solves the issue because it will be open source instead of proprietary. This means it can interface with any amp sim the can run on a computer and supports MIDI control. This gives the consumer access to all of their amp sims from one device. Since our project consists soley of the MIDI controller, it will be much cheaper then other amp modelers on the market. This is because the user will provide the interface and computer running the software, as apossed to paying for it with the MIIDI controller.

4. Refine your "answer" to the "problem"

In order to solve the problem, we will create an open source MIDI controller that can interface with any MIDI compatible amp sim running on a computer. The MIDI controller will allow for seamless switching & control of different amp sims from a single device
