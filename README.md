MIDI controller for virtual guitar amps (amp sims)

The idea behind this project is to create a MIDI controller modeled like a physical guitar amplifier.
The controller will connect to a PC running the user's virtual guitar rig of choice, providing control of the virtual rig's paramaters.
Modeling the controller after a physical guitar amplifier provides guitarists with a more conventional and inuitive way of dialing in their tone.
Instead of using a mouse to turn virtual knobs on computer screen, guitarts will be able turn knobs on a MIDI controller just like they would on a real amplifier.

In the current amp sim market, companies have capitalized on this by creating their own prorietary hardware units with their software preloaded into the unit.
These typically come in the form of a large footswitch, or as a rackmount unit.
While this solves the inconvenience of turning knobs with a mouse, this creates another issue: being locked into the software and hardware provided by the company you are purchasing from.
As it turns out, some of the best amp sims on the market today are only available as standalone applications that run on a PC.
Those that do come in hardware units leave the end user locked into that manufactures ecosystem.

The solution is this: a unit that provides the conveniece of controlling your all favourite amp sims, all from one place.
