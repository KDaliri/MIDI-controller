Scope Statement

This project involves creating a MIDI controller that is compatible with any amp sim software that supports MIDI control. This will give guitar players access to amp sims they already own from a device designed for use in a live setting. 

The controller aims to create an alternative to using amp modelers for live performace. Amp modelers keep the consumer tied to that manufacturers ecosystem, 
while our MIDI controller gives the consumer the freedom to use any compatible software that they already own. 

he controller will be physically modeled after a real guitar amp head, this gives guitarists a controller that is both famliar and intuitive. It will have knobs and switches that can be assigned to various parameters of the target amp sim. 
Changing the state or value of the MIDI controllers knobs or switches will change the value of the assigned parameter in the amp sim. 

The most common guitar amp controls will come pre-labeled accordingly for convenience, 
and extra controls will be available for assigning to other useful parameters that the software may provide.

*Due to time constraints, the following features may not be implemented:*

The controller will be able to switch between different applications on the host computer without needing to be reconfigured. A visual indicator will let the user keep track of which application is in focus.

The controller will have a footswitch to recall saved presets, toggle an effect, or send any other MIDI event during a live performance. Any change in value is reflected on the associated parameters LED.
