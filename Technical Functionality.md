Technical functionality:

Turning a potentiometer or pushing a switch will create an electrical signal

A microcontroller will be programmed to interperet that signal as a MIDI event

The micocontroller will interface with a MIDI compatible software on a computer via USB

The microcontroller will send the MIDI event to the application to change a value

the microcontroller will track the values of parameters in the application

The microcontroller will use lights to provide visual feedback on the value of parameters in the application

*The following feature is not confirmed:*

The microcontroller will interperet a non MIDI input to switch between running applications
